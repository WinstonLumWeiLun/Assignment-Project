            <h5> NETWORKING </h5>
            <p>I enjoy learning networking since it has caught my attention since I was a child. I became interested in networking because I believe it's very cool that I can solve problems that other people couldn't. I'd like to learn more about networking because it can help me toÂ troubleshoot or put some of my knowledge into use, and it will benefit me better when I enter the workforce since I've learned the fundamentals of networking.</p>
